# RPX - Reverse Proxy

RPX is a lightweight reverse proxy system implemented in Rust, designed as an alternative to tools like NGINX.
The main idea is to provide a Masterâ€“Worker architecture where the Master process dynamically creates and manages Workers.
Each Worker handles incoming connections and distributes requests efficiently across multiple backend servers.

### Architecture Overview

This sample demonstrates how the system initializes and manages communication between the Master, Workers, and Protected Server.

    M->>M: "Init Master Process on Thread."
    M->>W: Create Process
    W->>C: Create Socket to Client
end

end
```

Development
-----------
- Cargo

```bash
# make project
$ cargo run --release
$ binlocal -d ../rpx

# run project
$ rpx
```

Commits
-----------
For commits add structured for easy correction and detect issues

```bash
